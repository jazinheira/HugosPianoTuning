faqs:
- title: Why is regular piano tuning important?
  answer: Regular tuning ensures your piano sounds its absolute best, with all notes perfectly in tune for an optimal listening and playing experience. It also prevents further going out of tune.

- title: How often should I tune my piano?
  answer: Tune at least twice a year. Pianos go out of tune over time due to fluctuations in humidity and temperature. Twice-yearly tuning keeps it sounding amazing all year.

- title: What's involved in a piano evaluation?
  answer: A comprehensive inspection of all components - soundboard, action, strings, cabinet, and more. Evaluates condition, playing performance, repairs needed, and remaining lifespan.

- title: Why get my keys cleaned?
  answer: Cleaning removes built-up grime, oils, and bacteria from fingers. This maximizes key responsiveness, preserves appearance, and ensures cleanliness.

- title: Can humidity really affect my piano?
  answer: Absolutely! Pianos are highly sensitive to humidity levels. Swings can cause wood components to swell or shrink, drastically impacting tuning stability.
  
- title: What's regulation and why is it important?
  answer: Regulation optimizes the mechanical operation and touch of your piano's action for an even response across all keys. It's key for control and expression.
